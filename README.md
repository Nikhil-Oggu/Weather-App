# Weather-App
We will retrieve the current weather data from the Fess API provided by OpenWeatherMap and seamlessly display it on our website or app. This includes essential information such as temperature, weather conditions, hur the specified city. All of this will be made possible through the use of Free API and JavaScript on our website.
